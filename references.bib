                  self-directed learning and professional skill

  abstract =	 {Based upon a successful implementation of an
                  upper-division project based learning (PBL)
                  curriculum, an integrated first/second year PBL
                  experience was designed and implemented. The
                  integrated courses were physics 1, statics, design,
                  and professionalism. The curriculum has been
                  delivered from 2012 to 2015. This work in progress
                  paper describes the design process, the trajectory
                  of the program as it continuously improved, data
                  collection methods, and initial results. Two of the
                  members of this research team were members of the
                  team that adapted the Aalborg (Denmark) model of PBL
                  to an upper division 100\% PBL curriculum. The model
                  evolved into an ABET accredited program that is
                  based on the solution of complex industry problems
                  for the last four semesters of a bachelors
                  degree. The results were used as the basis for the
                  design of this lower division PBL program. The lower
                  division program evolved from 2012 to 2015. Upon
                  conclusion of the lower division experience, survey
                  instruments were administered to students. Tools
                  specific to self-directed learning and professional
                  development were employed. The instruments are the
                  Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire
                  (MSLQ) and professional development and professional
                  expectations instruments designed by the authors of
                  this paper.},
